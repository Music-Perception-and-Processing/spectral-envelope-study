# spectral-envelope-study

This repository contains parts of the code for the following study:

Siedenburg, K., Jacobsen, S., Reuter, C. "Spectral envelope position and shape in sustained musical instrument sounds." 2021

Not all of the existing data could be uploaded due to size limits. If you are interested in the classification data, please do not hesitate to contact kai.siedenburg@uni-oldenburg.de or simon.jacobsen@uni-oldenburg.de and we will find a way to make it available for you.

Nonetheless, you can run the code and generate the data yourself. Be aware though, that running the entirety of the code takes up to an hour to complete!
